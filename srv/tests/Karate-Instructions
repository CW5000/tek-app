Note: as this is a demo created around throwaway tests, I opted to utilize the standalone executable 
rather than build a more versatile solution around POM. So I hope this doesn't reflect negatively on me. Yes, we normally don't
suck JARs and EXEs into a repository because we can just build them locally, but in this case, the situation called for something
quick and dirty.

So, how do I run the API tests?

This is fairly simple - make sure you have Java installed (I think JRE is all that is necessary for the stand-alone) 
and download this repository.

Using your command line, navigate to the directory containing the Karate-0.9.3.jar. Use the following command to ignite:
Java jar karate-0.9.3.jar search_by_state_abbre_tests.feature.
